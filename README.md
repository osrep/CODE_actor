# CODE_actor
A repository for the CODE actor implementation into ETS.

This repository is created for the implementaton of the CODE code (can be found in a Github project with the same name) into the European Transport Simulator workflow. The scripts in this project are only usable if the NORSE code itself is available, and the program is run in the ETS framework.
